![Hey, I'm Yuri Sementsov](hello.png)

Iâ€™m aÂ Front-End Engineer, Software Architect, and Tech Lead atÂ [Ecentria](https://ecentria.com) / [Intexsys](https://www.intexsys.lv), where IÂ work onÂ creating user-friendly and high-performance e-commerce stores. With over 20Â years ofÂ experience inÂ web development, Iâ€™m passionate about Front-End, UI/UX, FrontOps, JAMstack, and Web Performance optimization. 

I help business streamline their front-end development process, train and mentor developers and teams, design app architecture, solve performance issues, and upgrade their codebase. Although I don't actively participate in Open Source projects, I'm always happy to share my knowledge and expertise on web performance optimization or codebase modernization.
